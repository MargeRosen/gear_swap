== README.md  Gear Swap

Buy, sell and swap your musical gear.

Musical instrument categories provide a convenient way to find the gear you want.

Registered can post listings of musicial instruments, accessories and assorted gear for sale/swap. They can also see the contact info provided on other listings.

Registration is easy and 100% free!

Listings only appear on the site for one week after they're created, so you'll only see the most up-to-date info.


Development Collaborators' note: If you git clone the repo don't forget to add your own application.yml file for development testing.
