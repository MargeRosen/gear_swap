      We don't send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.
      Account information is password-protected. Keep your password safe.
      Forums use basic webserver authentication. Close your browser to log out.
      Gear Swap does not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 13. If Gear Swap learns that a posting is by a person under the age of 13, Gear Swap will remove that post.
      Gear Swap, or people who post on Gear Swap, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy practices.
